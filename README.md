## Overview

![Final Solution]()


### Vision Statement
For this project I wanted to create a tool where I can easily get as many hints as I wanted for crossword prompts if I need them to better understand what the word could be. I am starting to get more into crossword puzzles to help with my memory and when I started on the easy puzzles in a new york times crossword journal I severily underestimated the difficulty for the words themselves, and so I was creating this tool to help with it so I can get better with time and might not need this tool.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Fluent UI
- Typescript
- Open AI

### What I learned
- For this project I wanted to learn more about how to work with typescript and react
- I also wanted to learn how to connect open AI api to react web app
- Currently for work I am using fluent UI frequently and want to learn more about it by using it on this project


### Continued development
- As I use the tool I might think of new features I could add to the project

## Design Principles

1. Appreciate that people make mistakes
2. Value people and make systems that work for them
3. Keep it simple
4. Modularize, break things down, use good organization, make it understandable
5. Automate as much as possible
6. Create a system that prevents people from making mistakes
7. But not in such a way to prevent them from getting things done
